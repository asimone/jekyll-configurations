I had the good fortune of reconnecting with some old friends who got me back into Dungeons and Dragons. I have since, perhaps, gone a little overboard with the hobby.

I've also created a few digital spaces to help out Dungeon Masters be better equipped to run campaigns for players who have more modern expectations.


<h4>Laughing Beholder</h4>

The goal of <a href="https://laughingbeholder.com/">Laughing Beholder</a> was completely self-serving: I wanted to create such a good repository of Spelljammer content that people would just start sending me stuff, so I didn't have to spend so much time preping for my own campaign. 


It's slowly grown (and will continue to do so), but the core premise is only to highlight the best Spelljammer content for digital and digitally augmented play.

<h4>Dungeon Masters Tools</h4>

This is less aesthetically pleasing as the previous site, but more functional. It has a variety of tables that are mobile friendly I can use for quick reference on my phone using Bootstrap. 


I stole a <a href="https://github.com/crobi/dnd5e-quickref">Player Reference Page</a> and a <a href="https://dungeonbot.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/simple-weather-lookup-chart">weather table</a> to help fill out some areas that weren't easily translatable directly from the 5th edition Dungeon Masters Guide.
