The big debate around charging for App.net seems to circle around how folks use the service. Take, for instance, <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/you-cant-start-the-revolution-from-the-country-club.html">Anil Dash</a>:
>Much of my own success is, as I’ve said, attributable largely to me having gained access to online social networks earlier than most people. Being early and loud will give you a better shot at being heard than anyone who comes after you.

>And for better or worse, I’m one of those people who tends to get invited to these private parties early. I feel I’ve earned it, but certainly some of the reason I get invited is that I’m part of the (not-so-)old boys’ club. Which means the only way I can justify my presence and participation is if I make sure to articulate how others can have their own access even if they don’t share my particular set of advantages.

Success is defined as being heard on a social network. Contrast this with Nevin:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" lang="en"><p>This may help explain my thinking on App•net: I use Twitter not as a social network (I don&#39;t follow family etc.) but as a content source.</p>&mdash; Neven Mrgan (@mrgan) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgan/statuses/236128247539195904">August 16, 2012</a></blockquote>

Do you want to speak or listen? Of course, you need both to have a social network, but which you prefer will undoubtedly shape your rhetoric.
