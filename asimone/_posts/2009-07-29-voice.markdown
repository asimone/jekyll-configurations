I have been mucking around a bit with sound equipment recently and have been particularly curious about the real world voices of bloggers and their relationship to their writings. So, in that spirit, I thought you would get a kick out of a few thoughts on Von Trier's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogville"><em>Dogville</em></a>.

My friend Rick asked me <a href="http://www.clusterflock.org/2009/07/clusterflock-interviews-clusterflock-2-dogville-edition.html">these questions</a> in the new-ish <em>clusterflock interviews clusterflock</em> series:

<strong>Q:</strong> Andrew, I just finished watching <em>Dogville,</em> the second time. You spoke of “shaking for days,” after seeing it. If you can recall, what shook you?

(I ask because I’m shaking again, or at least, I’m <em>haunted.</em>)

<strong>Q:</strong> What have you carried with you, since viewing the film. Were you <em>changed</em> in some <em>elemental</em> way?
