Loafing in front of Messhugah Cafe is something of an endurance sport for me. I live just around the corner and pretty much treat it as my living room/kitchen. On Saturdays I often roll out of bed and into clothes, <em>sans</em> shower, and <del datetime="2008-09-30T18:51:32+00:00">stroll</del> stumble to the caf√© for coffee. These particular sounds, however, were on a Wednesday night, after six, when the usual busker was jamming on his guitar and another one, just walking by, decides to join in with his harmonica: the perfect frame for a slouched form enjoying a cigarette and Pabst.
