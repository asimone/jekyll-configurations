Lately, my notions of philosophy has been shifting and I think it has some traction. Recent interaction with authors and cohorts suggests there has been break with the Socratic perspectives of philosophy, its <em>love</em> of wisdom, and movement towards an onanistic joy of theoretical systems (I am accusing no one who reads this blog of making that mistake).

Why describe it as <em>onanistic</em> joy?

Because only engaging (calculating?) the theoretical, that is to say the general or "universal" does not produce. It cannot be truly <em>productive, </em>i.e. productive <em>in the world</em> —there are certainly no fruits of love. It is nearly pornographic, looking at everything in general without recognizing the particular presented. One might (<em>might</em>, mind you) call it objectifying.

On the flip side, solely engaging the event, the happening, the <em>singular</em> experience <em>in </em>history does not simply do it  justice either. Firstly, to call <em>each</em> event singular, is to catch oneself in a generalization of a particular, that is to say commit a "contradiction" (in the most etymological sense: contra<em>-diction</em>). Secondly, to <em>singularize</em> the event would be to place it outside of the category of other events in such a way that it is <em>utterly</em> incomparable and each event, now singular, is also a nonevent (for to use a word is to speak in a generality). This, too, <em>de</em>-values (in its <em>least</em> economic sense) the event and rather than <em>object-</em>ify it creates a ghost, an almost non-thing.

<strong>For example:</strong>

To call a woman beautiful is to set her apart, to say she is other, that is, <em>except-</em>tional —she is a singularity. Yet<em>,</em> in order for this to have meaning, for the women to accept it as compliment, she must see herself as comparable to other women, still comparable in a way that is dis-comparable. There must be violence to be comparable but not <em>too</em> <em>much </em>violence lest the compliment lose its meaning.

It is in this space, between the universal and the particular, that one practices <em>sophia,</em> wisdom: a place where one may respect a thing's or event's uniqueness and its commonality without doing violence (or, at least, not <em>too much</em> violence). To be wise one must stand between, to see both with balance, which is to say act according to good judgment. It is an art to be practiced.
